# Hichem HAMDAOUI frontend Assestment for CluePoints
This work is a delivery for CluePoints Frontend Assestment in June 2021 for the company CluePoints.
Duration of the assestment was a week of work. I progressed on it during my free time as I had my own work related to my position at Codix to process.
The assestment description is [here](https://github.com/hichem1987/cluePoints/blob/main/Frontend%20Engineer%20Assessment.pdf)  .
A Link where the work is deployed is [here](https://hichem1987.github.io/cluePoints/)   
The project is about consuming an API containing data about virtual clients and the payment cards they use.
The objective is showing data in several graphs using multiple type of filters.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.3.
